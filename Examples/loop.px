-- Prolixity has the basic control structures that you find in other languages

-- branching
var x
var y
x = 5
y = 10

if x < y, begin ...
  print "x < y"
...end, else begin ...
  print "it's not that x < y"
...end

-- while
while x < y, begin...
  print x
  x = x + 1
...end

-- in fact, "if" and "while" are syntactic sugars, see the "Smalltalkish" for details!

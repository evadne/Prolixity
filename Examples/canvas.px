-- I plan to implement simple canvas graphics support in Prolixity, maybe Logo-ish?

-- for now, here's what we have (for more complex stuff, see "UIKit Graphics" section)
-- this is silly, I know

var i
i = 100

while i < 460, begin ...
  Var j
  J = 100
  while j < 460, begin ...
    -- canvas is an exported object from our app
    on canvas, invoke draw dot, taking point i, j
    j = j + 20
  ... end
  i = i + 20
...end
